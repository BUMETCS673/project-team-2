## Team Members Description

#### Security Leader: Hanwen Zhang
I work as a fullstack software engineer (junior) at a healthcare technology company based in New York City. The tech stack at my current work project is using Javascript/React for the frontend and Ruby-on-Rails for the backend. I also have some experience with Java/Spring Boots along with some understanding of SQL/NoSQL database. Outside of work, I like to workout, go for a run or walk around the city, and explore something new like cuisine or restaurant.

#### QA Leader: Whitney To
I am currently working as a junior software engineer at a financial institution in Delaware. I use mainly Java/SpringBoot for work as well as React/JS and SQL/Oracle-DB. I'm very excited and look forward to working with everyone in the team to complete this project.
