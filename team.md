## Team Members Description

### Team Leader: Will Aftring
I am currently working as a Windows debug engineer primarily working on the Windows authentication stack (Kerberos, NTLM, TLS) and the Windows container runtime (docker, containerd). Most of my development experience is in C/C++, C# but I often have to debug x86 and arm64 assembly.

#### Security Leader: Hanwen Zhang
I work as a fullstack software engineer (junior) at a healthcare technology company based in New York City. The tech stack at my current work project is using Javascript/React for the frontend and Ruby-on-Rails for the backend. I also have some experience with Java/Spring Boots along with some understanding of SQL/NoSQL database. Outside of work, I like to workout, go for a run or walk around the city, and explore something new like cuisine or restaurant.

#### QA Leader: Whitney To
I am currently working as a junior software engineer at a financial institution in Delaware. I use mainly Java/SpringBoot for work as well as React/JS and SQL/Oracle-DB. I'm very excited and look forward to working with everyone in the team to complete this project.

#### Requirements Leader: Christan Pratt
My name is Christan Pratt and I am from the Bahamas. I am currently enrolled in the MS in Software Development at Boston University Metropolitan College. I work at the Central Bank of the Bahamas and develop business intelligence solutions.  Although I have naturally gravitated to and learned my software development, I know that my development skills can be enhanced. 
I have taken the following courses thus far  INFO STR W/JAVA (CS520), DATA STRUC&ALGO (CS526), ADV PROG TECH (CS622), SW DESIGN & PAT (CS665), Web Application Development (CS601), and Server Side Web (CS602). Although I have learnt Java in my classes, I have not used the SpringBoot framework.  I am a jack of  many, but a master of none. I have 2 -3 classes left and I am excited about this course, the term long project and the valuable lessons that can be exchanged among the team members.
